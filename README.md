# BCD-Adder-using-quantum-gates
Implementation of BCD adder is done using quantum multiple gates. The 
input for this circuit is two 4 bits ( addend and augend ). It is different from 
existing quantum BCD adder because the inputs are given by the user in 
runtime. This solution is a generalized one.
